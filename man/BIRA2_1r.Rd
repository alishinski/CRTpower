  tails = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{R2_1}{Proportion of variance in level 1 outcome explained by level 1 covariates}

\item{R2_2T}{Proportion of between block variance in treatment effect explained by Level 2 covariates}

\item{P}{Proportion of level 1 units randomized to the treatment}

\item{g}{Number of level 2 covariates}

\item{n}{Average Block Size (mean # of level 1 units per level 2 unit)}

\item{J}{Number of level 2 units}

\item{rho}{proportion of variance in outcome between clusters}

\item{omega}{Treatment effect heterogeneity:  variability in treatment effects across Level 2 units, standardized by the variability in the Level-2 outcome}

\item{alpha}{Probability of a type I error}

\item{power}{Statistical power (1 - probability of type II error)}

\item{tails}{One or two tailed test}
