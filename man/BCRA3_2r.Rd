\item{R2_T3}{Proportion of between block variance in treatment effect explained by Level-3 covariates}

\item{P}{Proportion of the level 3 units randomized to the treatment}

\item{g_3}{Number of level 3 Covariates used}

\item{n}{Mean # of level 1 units per level 2 unit}

\item{J}{Mean # of level 2 units per level 3 unit}

\item{K}{Number of level 3 units}

\item{rho_2}{proportion of variance in outcome that is between level 2 units}

\item{rho_3}{proportion of variance in outcome that is between level 3 units}

\item{omega_3}{Level 3 treatment effect heterogeneity: variance in treatment effect across Level 3 units, standardized by Level-3 outcome variation}
